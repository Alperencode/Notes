# Flutter Notes

I'll keep taking notes about things to remember while learning flutter. I'll keep this note updated when I take more notes.

**Flutter**: A "tool" that allows you to build **native cross-platform** apps with one programming language and codebase

<br>

**Widget**: Re-usable UI building blocks

**Warning-1**: You can only extend one class at a time

<br>

**Warning-2**: Every widget in flutter needs to extend Stateless widget or Stateful widget
