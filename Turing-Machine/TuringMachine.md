## Turing Machine

Turing Machine: The Turing machine mathematically models a machine that mechanically operates on a tape. Imagine a tape by just ones and zeros. Turing machine can read and write on that tape and can determinete what to do next by using contidional branching.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an example:  "in state 42, if the symbol seen is 0, write a 1; if the symbol seen is 1, change into state 17; in state 17, if the symbol seen is 0, write a 1 and change to state 6;"
