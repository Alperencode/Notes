## Turing Complete

Turing Complete: do anything that a [Turing Machine](https://github.com/Alperencode/Notes/blob/master/Turing-Machine/TuringMachine.md) do.

### 1) Conditional Branching:
- "if statements"
- "go-to" (not a good thing to have in well structured programming but still)

### 2) Arbitrary Amounts of Memory
It means the totality of RAM that you possess, you must be able to get as much memory as much the problem needs.

(So that means none of our computers are Turing machines, because they've all got finite memory)
