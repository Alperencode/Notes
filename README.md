# Notes
In this repository I'll take notes about Computer Science, general terms and things I'm researching or I'm curious about to learn.

## Current Notes

- [Turing Complete](https://github.com/Alperencode/Notes/blob/master/Turing-Complete/TuringComplete.md) :  What is Turing Complete and what programming languages need to have to be Turing complete.
